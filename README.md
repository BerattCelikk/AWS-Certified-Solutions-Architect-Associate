## 📖 Project Overview

The **CloudArchitect: AWS SAA-C03 Mastery** repository is an advanced technical knowledge base curated for mastering the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate** certification. Developed under the **Codiom** initiative, this project represents the evolution from cloud practitioner fundamentals to professional-level system design.

As a Software Engineering student at Istanbul Aydın University, I have structured these resources to focus on the four primary domains of modern cloud architecture: Resiliency, High Performance, Security, and Cost Optimization.

---

## ✨ Key Domains

This repository is strictly aligned with the **SAA-C03** exam guide, covering:

* **🏗️ Domain 1: Design Resilient Architectures**
    * Multi-tier architecture patterns. 
    * High availability via Multi-AZ deployments and Auto Scaling.
    * Disaster Recovery (DR) strategies: Backup & Restore, Pilot Light, Warm Standby, and Multi-site.
* **⚡ Domain 2: Design High-Performing Architectures**
    * Scalable storage solutions: **S3**, **EFS**, and **FSx**.
    * High-performance databases: **Aurora**, **DynamoDB** (DAX), and **ElastiCache**.
    * Global content delivery: **CloudFront** and **Global Accelerator**.
* **🛡️ Domain 3: Design Secure Applications and Architectures**
    * Deep dive into **VPC** security: Security Groups, NACLs, and Private Links.
    * Identity management: **IAM Policies**, **Roles**, and **AWS Organizations**.
    * Data protection: Encryption at rest (KMS) and in transit (TLS).
* **💰 Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures**
    * Rightsizing compute resources and selecting optimal instance types.
    * S3 Lifecycle policies and intelligent tiering.
    * Cost-effective networking and data transfer strategies.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The notes are structured around the **AWS Well-Architected Framework**, emphasizing the design of systems that can evolve and scale effectively.



### Architectural Focus Points
* **Decoupling Systems:** Utilizing **SQS**, **SNS**, and **EventBridge** for asynchronous communication.
* **Serverless First:** Prioritizing event-driven designs to minimize operational overhead.
* **Hybrid Cloud:** Implementing **Direct Connect** and **Site-to-Site VPN** for on-premise integration.
